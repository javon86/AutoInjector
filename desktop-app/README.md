# AutoInjector Desktop

One program, one window: ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini as three real Chromium panes
side by side, with a control panel that lets you route messages between them —
by copy/paste-style DOM automation, no API keys, using your normal logged-in
sessions. It's built for using two (or three) AIs together as thinking partners:
you send them a problem, and route replies between them however you want —
one-off, or on autopilot.

This is the desktop counterpart to the `AutoInjector/extension` Chrome extension —
same automation idea (type into the chat box, click send, watch for the reply),
just packaged as a standalone app instead of a browser extension, so you don't
need Chrome open with three tabs.

## Requirements

- Node.js — the one thing you need installed. Get it free from
  [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (pick the **LTS** button), run the installer,
  click through with defaults, done. (This is what actually runs the app — there's
  no separate "AutoInjector install", it's not on an app store.)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux desktop (Electron doesn't run on Android/iOS — see the
  root `README.md` for the Android path, which reuses the browser extension in
  Kiwi Browser instead)

## Quick start (recommended — no typing commands)

1. Get the code onto your computer: on the GitHub page for this repo, click the
   green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**, then unzip it wherever you like.
   (If you already use git, `git clone` works too.)
2. Open the `desktop-app` folder.
3. Double-click:
   - **Windows** → `run-windows.bat`
   - **macOS** → `run-mac.command`
     (macOS will likely warn "unidentified developer" the first time — right-click
     the file → **Open** → **Open** to approve it once. See "macOS Gatekeeper" below
     if you still get blocked.)
   - **Linux** → open a terminal in that folder and run `./run-linux.sh`
     (or double-click it if your file manager runs `.sh` scripts)
4. First time only: a black/terminal window pops up and installs dependencies —
   this takes a minute or two and only happens once. After that it opens the app
   window automatically.
5. Every time after that, the same double-click just opens the app directly
   (a few seconds).

That's the "one click" version — the launcher script handles installing and
starting for you. Nothing gets installed system-wide; it all lives inside the
`desktop-app` folder (well, inside its `node_modules` subfolder), so deleting the
folder removes it cleanly.

### macOS Gatekeeper

If double-clicking `run-mac.command` does nothing or says it's damaged/blocked,
open Terminal, `cd` into the `desktop-app` folder, and run:
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine run-mac.command
```
then double-click it again.

## Run it manually (if you prefer the terminal)

```bash
cd desktop-app
npm install
npm start
```

On first launch each pane loads its site's normal web login page — sign in to
ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini directly in their panes, the same as any browser tab.
Each site gets its own isolated, persistent session (`persist:chatgpt`,
`persist:claude`, `persist:gemini`), so you only need to sign in once; it's
remembered across restarts. Use each pane's **Reload** button in the control panel
if a pane gets stuck or you need to re-navigate.

## Using it

Each AI gets one merged column: a compact control strip on top (status, preview,
Forward/Auto/Regenerate buttons), its actual live browser pane directly below.
There's no separate "cards row" and "browser strip" anymore — unchecking that
AI in **Participants** collapses just its pane, but its control strip (and its
last captured reply) stays visible and usable.

1. Sign in to whichever sites you want to include, right in their panes.
2. **Participants** (top): uncheck any AI you want to sit out of Auto/"All" —
   its pane collapses too, since there's nothing to watch if it's not in play.
3. **Compose** (top-left): type a message and click **→ ChatGPT** / **→ Claude** /
   **→ Gemini** / **→ All** to send it to one, some, or all checked participants —
   this is also how you interject at any point, auto running or not. It warns you
   if a message is long enough that a site might choke on it.
4. The moment a pane's reply finishes streaming (checked every ~1.5s, waits for
   the text to stop changing), a soft chime plays, its column's preview updates,
   and it's logged to the transcript. While waiting on a reply, that column shows
   a pulsing amber dot; the instant it sends something new to another AI, that
   AI's whole column glows briefly so you can actually follow who's talking to
   whom. Forwarded replies are always labeled (`[ChatGPT says] ...`).
5. **Global controls**:
   - **Auto** — turns on full back-and-forth forwarding between every checked
     participant: whatever one says gets forwarded to the others, whose replies
     get forwarded back, and so on — this is the "three-way conversation" mode.
     With 2+ participants it will run indefinitely once started.
   - **Pause** — halts all forwarding but keeps your participant selection, so
     hitting **Auto** again picks up where you left off.
   - **Stop** — halts all forwarding *and* unchecks every participant, forcing a
     deliberate restart.
   - A column's own **Forward**/**Auto → X**/**↻ Regenerate** buttons still work
     independently, for fine-grained one-off routes or resending a prompt that
     missed the mark, instead of the full-mesh version.
6. **📌** on any transcript turn pins it, so you can spot it again later without
   scrolling back through everything.
7. **Copy Transcript** / **Download .md** save the running conversation locally
   (pinned turns are marked in the export) so you can share it elsewhere.

## House Rules

Instead of manually wiring up Forward/Auto buttons, **House Rules** (in the
Global area) structures the whole conversation for you — pick a format, hit
**Start**, and it runs itself. It uses whatever's typed in **Compose** as the
topic/goal. While a House Rules run is active, the manual Auto/Pause buttons
are disabled (Stop always works and ends both) so there's only one thing
driving the conversation at a time.

- **Who Wants to Speak?** — each round, every checked AI is asked whether it
  has something worth adding (reply YES or NO). Only the ones that say yes get
  asked for their real point, which then gets recapped to everyone before the
  next round's check-in. Nobody's forced to talk every round.
- **Debate** — a fixed, randomly-shuffled speaking order. Each speaker
  responds to whoever went right before them, then hands off to the next.
  Runs for the **Rounds** you set (0 = until you hit Stop).
- **Free-for-All** — everyone's told the topic and can jump in on each other
  at any point — the open, unstructured version. Runs until you Stop it (no
  rounds limit).
- **Devil & Angel** *(needs all 3 participants checked)* — roles are
  auto-assigned, not user-picked: one AI is **Middle** (has the goal), one is
  **Devil** (attacks it), one is **Angel** (defends it). Middle's statement
  goes to both Devil and Angel; their replies both come back to Middle only —
  Devil and Angel never see each other — and Middle responds to both at once
  before the cycle repeats.
- **Chargeback** *(needs all 3 checked, and a Rounds value)* — two AIs
  (auto-assigned) argue opposite sides of the topic directly with each other;
  the third is a neutral **Referee** who watches everything live but stays
  silent until the rounds run out, then delivers a verdict naming a winner
  (marked with a 🏆 in the transcript).
- **Brainstorm** — collaborative, not adversarial: everyone builds on what's
  already been suggested. Runs like Free-for-All until you click **Wrap Up**,
  at which point one participant (auto-picked) is asked to pull everything
  into one final, fully fleshed-out plan (marked with a ✅ in the transcript).

Role assignments show up as a small badge next to that AI's name once a mode
with roles is running.

### Troubleshooting

The **Activity / Troubleshooting** panel next to the transcript logs every
internal action live — polls that captured a new reply, sends, forwards, errors,
routing/participant changes — each with a timestamp, so if something isn't
working you can see exactly where it's getting stuck instead of guessing.

If a specific AI's card never shows a captured reply even though its pane clearly
has one on screen, that means the DOM selector for reading its messages
(`selectors.js`) doesn't match that site's current layout — sites change their
markup without notice. Click the 🔍 button on that AI's card to open Chrome
DevTools on that exact pane, right-click the assistant's reply bubble → **Inspect**,
and send me the element's tag/class/attributes — that's what lets me fix the
selector for real instead of guessing again.

## How it's built

- `main.js` — Electron main process. Creates the window, one `WebContentsView` per
  AI site plus one full-window `WebContentsView` for the control panel. Each site's
  pane is positioned by measuring an empty placeholder div (`#pane-slot-<site>`)
  inside the control panel's own HTML and copying its exact on-screen rectangle,
  so the live pane sits directly under that AI's control strip and collapses
  cleanly when the participant is unchecked — no hardcoded split. Polls each
  pane's latest reply every ~1.5s to detect when it's finished streaming, routes
  messages (manual, per-pane auto, or the global full-mesh Auto) between panes,
  and keeps an in-memory activity log of everything that happens. The House
  Rules formats are small state machines layered on top of the same capture
  events — each one reacts to a new reply by deciding who gets sent what next,
  based on whichever format is active.
- `automation.js` / `selectors.js` — build two small scripts run inside each AI's
  pane via `webContents.executeJavaScript()`: one to type text into the chat box
  and click send, one to just read whatever the latest reply currently says.
  Mirrors the selectors used by the browser extension's `content.js`/`selectors.js`.
- `controls.html` / `controls.js` / `preload.js` — the control panel UI, talking to
  the main process over `ipcRenderer`/`contextBridge` (no direct Node access from
  the page, same as the sites' own panes).

Selectors are best-effort with fallbacks, same caveat as the extension: if a site
redesigns its chat UI, `selectors.js` is the first place to fix — use the 🔍
Inspect button described above to get the real answer instead of guessing.

## Building a real installer (.exe / .dmg / .AppImage)

The `run-*` scripts above are the fastest way to get running (they still need
Node.js once), but if you want an actual double-clickable installer that bundles
Node/Electron so nothing needs to be installed at all, this repo is wired up for
that too, via [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/):

```bash
cd desktop-app
npm install
npm run dist          # builds for whatever OS you're running this on
# or target a specific OS explicitly:
npm run dist:win      # -> dist/*.exe (NSIS installer)
npm run dist:mac      # -> dist/*.dmg
npm run dist:linux    # -> dist/*.AppImage
```

The output lands in `desktop-app/dist/`. That installer file is the thing you'd
actually hand someone else to install with one double-click, no Node.js required
on their end. Building for an OS other than the one you're on ("cross-building",
e.g. making a `.exe` from macOS/Linux) can need extra platform tooling — building
on the target OS itself is the most reliable option.

I wired up the config but haven't produced/tested an actual build here (this
dev environment can't download the Electron binaries needed to build) — if
`npm run dist` errors out for you, send me the output and I'll fix the config.
